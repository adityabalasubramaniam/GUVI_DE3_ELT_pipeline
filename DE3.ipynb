    "# Server Log Data Extraction and User History Database Update\n",
    "\n",
    "### Author:  Aditya Balasubramaniam    \n",
    "### Last Updated:  August 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Title:** Server Log Data Extraction and User History Database Update  \n",
    "**Technologies:**  Python, SQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Regex  \n",
    "**Dataset:**  mbox.txt (Email server log file)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to fetch data from a server log file, extract all email addresses along with their corresponding dates, and upload this data into a user history database. The goal is to ensure the extracted data is clean, accurate, and accessible for further analysis and historical tracking.\n",
